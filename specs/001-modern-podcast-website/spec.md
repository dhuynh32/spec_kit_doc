## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a podcast listener, I want to discover and learn about a podcast through an engaging website, so that I can easily access episodes and information about the show.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a visitor lands on the homepage, **When** they first arrive, **Then** they should see a featured episode with prominent visuals and description
2. **Given** a user is on the episodes page, **When** they browse the content, **Then** they should see a paginated list of 20 episodes with thumbnails and descriptions
3. **Given** a user wants to learn more about the podcast, **When** they visit the About page, **Then** they should see information about the show and its creators

### Edge Cases
