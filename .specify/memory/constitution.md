# Static Web App Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Component Architecture
All UI elements MUST be built as reusable components. Components MUST be self-contained with clear interfaces and documentation. Breaking changes to component APIs require version bumps.

### II. Performance First
Assets MUST be optimized for production. Images MUST be compressed, scripts minified, and stylesheets purged of unused styles. Initial page load time MUST NOT exceed 3 seconds on 4G connections.

### III. Responsive Design
All pages and components MUST be responsive and functional across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop). Breakpoints MUST be consistently used across the application.

## Development Standards

### Code Organization
- Source code MUST be organized by feature or domain
- Shared components MUST reside in a common directory
- Assets MUST be organized by type (images, styles, scripts)
- Build artifacts MUST be excluded from version control

### Quality Requirements
- Code MUST pass linting before commit
- Components MUST include basic unit tests
- Accessibility standards MUST be met (WCAG 2.1 Level A)

## Governance

Constitution compliance is mandatory for all contributions. Amendments require:
1. Documentation of proposed changes
2. Performance impact assessment
3. Majority team approval
4. Migration plan for breaking changes
